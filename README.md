This application was created for the competition of computer creativity "UPgrade" from the CDO "Intellect" by a first-year student of the SPO ICTZI "KIT" group 4143 Huzyakaev Vadim (TTLC198).
It is intended for flashing AVR microcontrollers. The application implements such innovations that I have never encountered in other projects and which greatly facilitate interaction with MK. Some of the most necessary and convenient functions for beginners are: reading and writing to FLASH and EEPROM memory, reading and writing fuses and setting bits, and of course the built-in MK settings calculator, allowing even the most remote, it was clear how to configure AVR series microcontrollers.
